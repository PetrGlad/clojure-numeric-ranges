# clojure-numeric-ranges

Primitive operations for numeric ranges in Clojure.
Left (lower) bound is included, upper (higher) bound is excluded. 
Ranges are represented as 2 element vectors `[lower-bound, upper-bound]`
The library works with any bound values that have comparison operators.

## Why

Surprisingly I could not find such library so decided to write one.
